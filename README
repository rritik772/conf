zoxide but for projects

**NOTE** not tested for Windows and MacOS. PR helps

Usage:
1. make a new folder for config files
  1. Windows
    - %APPDATA%/conf/conf.toml
  2. Linux and MacOS
    - ~/.config/conf/conf.toml
  3. Config contains
  ```toml
  database_file = '~/.config/conf/db.sqlite'

  [editors.code]
  dir = '-a'
  file = '-g'
  ```
    - Explaination
      1. store database in path
      2. if environment has code as editor then use `-a` param to cd and `-g` to open file
      3. if toml does not have editor params then it will open like `cd $dir; $EDITOR $file`

2. Donwload binary
3. For adding file for the first time
  1. cd into project
  2. `conf my_awsome_folder_inside_project/my_awesome_file.py`
